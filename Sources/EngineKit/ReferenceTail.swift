// ReferenceTail.swift
// EngineKit — a cloning reference must never end on a sound it cuts off.
//
// Qwen3-TTS clones by CONTINUING the reference audio: its first generated
// frame picks up wherever the clip stops. Jeff's starter pack was cut at a
// flat 15.0 s, 60 ms into a word (quiet at -66 dB, then -48, -30, -24, -17),
// so every part opened by finishing that word: a blip after each seam, junk
// heard as "At", "100", "2000" before the first real word, and 2 renders in
// 8 of "At the top, ..." stuck as "At at at at" (Mac probe 2026-09-24, iOS
// builds 18 and 19 alike). Backing the clip off to its last quiet stretch
// fixed all of it: 0/8 stuck, and every part starts from silence.
//
// So: when a clip ends on speech-loud sound that starts after a real quiet
// stretch, it ends at that quiet instead. A clip that ends quiet, or fades
// out with no quiet before the end, is left alone.
//
// Applied where a reference enters a voice library (beside RefLoudness, in
// both apps), by voice-level for packs and voices already on disk, and by
// the iOS Qwen engine when it loads a reference (voices saved before this).
