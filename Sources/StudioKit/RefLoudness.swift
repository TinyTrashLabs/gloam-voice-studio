/// enters the library (#voice-loudness, 2026-08-29).
///
/// WHY HERE. A clone is exactly as loud as the reference it was cloned from,
/// and nothing downstream re-levels it — the iOS voice path is a plain gain
/// multiply with no compressor, so a quiet reference is quiet on every device
/// at every setting. Normalising at EXPORT would fix the shared .gvoice while
/// leaving the voice quiet in the app that made it; normalising at RENDER would
/// re-measure the same asset on every line. The library write is the one
/// boundary every voice crosses exactly once, however it arrived — recorded,
/// combined, or imported from someone else's pack.
///
/// The asset is otherwise untouched: this scales sample amplitudes inside the
/// existing `data` chunk and leaves the header, sample rate, channel count and
/// every other chunk exactly as they were. A reference is training material for
/// a cloning backend, so resampling or re-containering it to change its volume
/// would be a far larger change than the problem asks for.
