/// reachable (#voice-loudness, 2026-08-29).
///
/// WHY THIS EXISTS, given `AudioAssembler.loudnessGain` already did a version of
/// this. Measuring the library after the first pass showed the standard was only
/// being applied to about half of it, for two distinct reasons:
///
/// 1. **The peak ceiling blocked the boost.** Every under-target voice had a peak
///    already pegged near full scale (-0.2 to -1.0 dBFS) from a handful of
///    transients, so `min(wanted, ceiling)` refused to raise it at all: `joe`
///    sat at -25.8 dBFS RMS, 7.8 dB under a -18.0 target, and the normaliser
///    left it there. Refusing to boost is the safe answer only if clipping is
///    the only alternative — it isn't. Limiting the transients instead lets the
///    body of the clip come up while the peak still honours the ceiling.
///
/// 2. **RMS is not loudness.** `maceo-sad` and `david` measured an identical
///    -18.0 dBFS RMS and differ by 2.0 LU — audibly, and in the direction the
///    ear reports. Equalising RMS therefore cannot deliver "gain 1 means the
///    same thing for every voice", which is the entire contract. ITU-R BS.1770
///    K-weighting costs two biquads and removes most of that residual.
