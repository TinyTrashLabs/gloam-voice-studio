/// One talk break spoken as one performance.

/// A break longer than one render (the talker's 1024-slot window holds the reference, the text and the
/// generated frames) is split into parts. Rendered as independent lines, every part restarts from the
/// reference with a fresh random seed, so delivery, pace and energy jump at every join. A session instead:
///
/// * draws every part from ONE sampler stream, seeded once per break (deterministic: the same break, voice
///   and seed give the same audio);
/// * conditions each part on the part before it: the previous part's transcript and codec frames follow the
///   reference in the ICL prompt, the way Qwen continues its reference, so part N carries on from where part
///   N-1 stopped (dropped for a part whose frame budget it would shrink);
/// * starts the vocoder on the previous part's frames, so the decoder continues what was just played.
///
/// Parts are rendered in order with `render(_:)`; the engine lock is held per part, so other renders can
/// interleave between parts.
